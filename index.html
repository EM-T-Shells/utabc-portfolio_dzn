                <p class="about"> My name is Gokhan Emre Taskale, but everyone refers to me as, "Emre". I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with knowledge and experience in applying various modern and most sought after programming languages and technologies in building today's applications.
                    Prior to entering the technology sector, I was a former medical resident and graduated from medical school to obtain an MD degree. Fortunately, I have not regret making the transition. With much thanks to UT Austin's Coding Bootcamp in providing me a much needed boost into my new career.
                    I live in Temple, Texas with plans to move into the beautiful city of Austin with my dog and partner in crime, Linus. Linus a Boxer/Border-Collie mix, however his DNA test showed 8 breeds! He also happens to weight 110 pounds. That's why I gave him the nickname, "Big Baby".
                   Few hobbies of mine include Soccer (Go Arsenal!), Formula 1 racing, MMA, exercising, walking trails with Linus, and exploring new locations in the city.</p>

<!-- 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
